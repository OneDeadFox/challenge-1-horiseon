# challenge-1-horiseon

This is the repository for the first challenge of bootcamp. It is an on-the-job ticket challenge.

In this excersise I consolidated redundant CSS selectors, changed the tag labeling for semantic tags, and fixed a broken link for the search engine optimization buttonin the nav bar.
